# Bootstrap Theme Kit: Make your own Bootstrap 4 Themes

This is simple starter project to help you get started quickly when making a custom Bootstrap 4 theme.

There is a full tutorial avaiable at hackerthemes.com: [How to build your own Bootstrap themes](https://hackerthemes.com/kit).

This readme is the short version of that.

## What this project does

This repository includes a project structure with a build script that builds a custom CSS version of Bootstrap 4, using Gulp. You can
clone this repository, run the Gulp task and go right into modifying variables and adding styles. There's also an HTML file that contains
a neatly organized collection of Bootstrap components that fit a 1920x1080 display, so you can instantly see the outcome.


## Video Demonstration

There is a short demonstration of this project on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi5ffoE3mPc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi5ffoE3mPc)

## Prerequisites

- This works on Windows, macOS and Linux.
- Node Package Manager and Gulp are required. Make sure you can run `gulp -v` and `npm -v`.
- You can get Node at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), then install gulp using `npm install gulp-cli -g`

## Getting started

2. Clone this repo
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `gulp watch`
4. Look at `index.html` (ideally with a [local development webserver](https://askubuntu.com/questions/377389/how-to-easily-start-a-webserver-in-any-folder))
5. Add any Bootstrap Sass variables into `scss/_custom-variables.scss`
